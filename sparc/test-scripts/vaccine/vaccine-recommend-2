% Situation
%The following is an except from a CPG and a local customization of the CPG

% A general CPG (Clinical Practice Guideline) states

% There are two different brands of Hib vaccine, HbOC and PRPOMP. The guideline recommends that a child should receive all of one brand or all of the other. It takes four doses to complete the series using HbOC and three doses using PRPOMP.

% If a child has already received both brands (a mixed series), then all doses are treated as if they were HbOC and the four-dose schedule is used.

% A local customization of the CPG allows a special schedule using PRPOMP for dose 1 and HbOC for doses 2 to 4.



% AGENDA
% - Can actions that uses all of the same vaccine be generalized into one relation function?
% - Fix the part in which duplicate paths appear if history feature is used
% - Implement state system (in order to implement next vaccine feature)
% - Next vaccine feature
% - Implement weight heuristics


% How to read and debug output

% How to check if we are correct: 

% We want to make sure HOLDS is consistant with our output
% We check OCCURS to check that a good path is being suggested
% We checkk REMAIN_DOSE to make sure the remain_dose feature is working properly


% How to debug if there is a problem

% We use HISTORY to see if the history is being recoreded properly
