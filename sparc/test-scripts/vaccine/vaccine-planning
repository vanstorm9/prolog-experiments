% Situation
%=== The following is an except from a CPG and a local customization of the CPG ===

% A general CPG (Clinical Practice Guideline) states

% "There are two different brands of Hib vaccine, HbOC and PRPOMP. The guideline recommends that a child should receive all of one brand or all of the other. It takes four doses to complete the series using HbOC and three doses using PRPOMP.

% If a child has already received both brands (a “mixed series”), then all doses are treated as if they were HbOC and the four-dose schedule is used."

% A local customization of the CPG allows a special schedule using PRPOMP for dose 1 and HbOC for doses 2–4.
