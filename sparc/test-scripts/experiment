    % RULES FOR UPDATING THE STATE OF A PATIENT %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    
    % when the type of vaccine matches, we check for type and completion
    % type h updates regularly for 4 doses
    holds(contains(P, hboc, D + 1, complete), I + 1) :- 
        holds(contains(P, hboc, D, C), I),
        occurs(give(P, hboc), I),
        (D + 1) = 4.
        
    holds(contains(P, hboc, D + 1, incomplete), I + 1) :- 
        holds(contains(P, hboc, D, C),I),
        occurs(give(P, hboc), I),
        (D + 1) < 4.

    % type p updates regularly for 3 doses
    %hold(contains(PATIENT, p, DOSE + 1, complete), STEP + 1) :- 
    %    hold(contains(PATIENT, p, DOSE, STATUS), STEP),
    %    occurs(give(PATIENT, p), STEP),
    %    (DOSE + 1) = 3.
    %hold(contains(PATIENT, p, DOSE + 1, incomplete), STEP + 1) :- 
    %    hold(contains(PATIENT, p, DOSE, STATUS), STEP),
    %    occurs(give(PATIENT, p), STEP),
    %    (DOSE + 1) < 3.
        
    % when the type of vaccine administered does not match the previous dose, 
    % case 1: p for first dose and h for dose 2-4
    %hold(contains(PATIENT, h, DOSE + 1, incomplete), 2) :- 
    %    hold(contains(PATIENT, p, DOSE, STATUS), 1),
    %    occurs(give(PATIENT, h), 1),
    %    (DOSE + 1) < 4.
    % case 2: doses are mixed at any point, h plan will be followed for 4 doses
    % note that the rule should swap to run on plan h as defined above
    % the mistake MUST be added to the state then swap to h
    %hold(contains(PATIENT, h, DOSE + 1, incomplete), STEP + 1) :-
    %    hold(contains(PATIENT, V1, DOSE, STATUS), STEP),
    %    occurs(give(PATIENT, V2), STEP),
    %    V1 != V2,
    %    (DOSE + 1) < 4.

    % COMMON SENSE RULES %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

    % no two actions may occur for a patient at one step
    :- occurs(give(PATIENT, X1), STEP),
        occurs(give(PATIENT, X2), STEP),
        X1 != X2.

    % a state will not hold initially if it was not defined initially as held
    % -hold(F, 0) :- not hold(F, 0).

    % a patient may not have two states at one step 
    % the dose must increment at each step
    %:- hold(give(P, H1, D1, S1), I), 
    %    hold(contains(P, H2, D2, S2), I),
    %    D1 != D2.

    %% WORKING HERE

    % an action will not occur for a patient without a selected plan
    % note that patients that are objects must be declared as not having
    % a plan or the system may create one for them
    %-occurs(give(PATIENT, VACCINE), STEP) :- 
    %    -hold(contains(PATIENT, ANYVACCINE, ANYDOSE, ANYSTATUS), 0).

    % if goal is complete, there are no more vaccine adminstrations
    %hold(contains(P,V,D,complete),I+1) :- hold(contains(P,V,D,complete),I).
    %-occurs(A,I) :- hold(contains(P,V,D,complete),I).

    % PLANNING RULES  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

    % when goal is not reached, an action must be selected at each step
    occurs(A, I) | -occurs(A, I) :- not goal(I).

    % something happens when something is occuring
    happens(I) :- occurs(A, I).

    % it is not possible for nothing to happen when goal is not reached
    :- not happens(I), not goal(I).
    
    % success is reached when goal is true within some step count
    success(t) :- goal(I), I <= 4.

    % success must be reached
    :- not success(t).

    % the goal is the completion of vaccination for some patient
    goal(I) :- holds(contains(hanayo, V, D, complete), I).
